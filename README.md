# ðŸ¤–Artificial Intelligence : Smart Taxi Navigation System using A* Algorithm.
This repository contains the Assignments for ECE NTUA course *Artificial Intelligence*

## Project Description
The general scope of the project was: \\
*Given the position $(X,Y)$ of a client this $(X_i, Y_i)$ of specific taxis, find (a) the closest taxi to the client and (b) the best route that corresponds to this taxi*
The project was implemented into two (2) parts:
  1. In the **first part** we implemented the known $A^{*}$ *search algorithm* using the programming language **Java** to solve the previous navigation problem. The **input data** (the coordinates of the map for the city of Athens, the coordinates of the client and the coordinates of thet taxis) were harvested from *OpenStreetMaps*[https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/38.359/23.810], whereas the **output data** (the coordinates of the route followed by the chosen taxi) were plotted using *MyMaps*[https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/]
